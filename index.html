        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The <b>head element</b> contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>body element</b> represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The <b>h1, h2,</b> etc elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>p elements represent a  paragrapgh block of text.</li>
          <li>ul, ol and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists and list items.</li>
          <li>img elements contain information about images dispalyed on the webpage. This elements contains various attributes; <b>src is the most important</b>. This defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li><b>br element</b> creates a line of empty space, or a line break between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li><b>a element</b> (which stands for <b>anchor</b>) creates links to the same webpage or others. <b>href</b> attribute points to the URL for the link</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head. Add code after the final meta element but before the title element.</li>
          <li><b>Declarations</b> contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li><b>Class attributes</b> as a selector allows us to share a <b>CSS</b> rule to any element we choose. For Ex: using the class selector .card to syle each topic in the Prework Study Guide. </li>

          <li>git add -A: commit all files in the working branch</li>
          <li>git commit -m "message*": adds commit message. Short and descriptive of changes made.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pull base(main) branch to our feature branch.</li>
          <li>git push origin (insert branch name): pushes branch to the main branch.</li>
          <li>git clone: clone or copy a repo to a new directory or location.</li>
          <li>git remote -v: verifies connection from local to cloud repo.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Declare a variable using var, then followed by a name for it. For example var topics = "HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript"; array of names or variables listed in quotes are called a string.</li>
          <li>Conditional statements and loops control the order in wich code is executed.The computer will check if these conditions are truthy. If so, it'll proceed with the action defined in the curly bracket. If not, then the condition will be ignored.</li>
          <li>If more than one condition using <b>else if</b> will allow multiple conditions till a condtion is truthy and run the code associated.</li>
          <li><b>Array</b> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li><b>Index</b> is a unique number assigned to data in an array. <b>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1</b></li>
          <li><b>Function</b> is a simple set of instructions tat tells the computer how to perform a certain task. Similar to if statements and loops, code that is written in the curly brackets {} will be executed.</li>
          <li><b>IMPORTANT</b> A function's name is followed by parentheses ().</li>
